### gpsd  GPS service daemon
gpsd is a service daemon that monitors one or more GPSes or AIS receivers attached to a host computer through serial or USB ports, making all data on the location/course/velocity of the sensors available to be queried on TCP port 2947 of the host computer.

Applications that presently use gpsd include Kismet, GpsDrive, gpeGPS, roadmap, roadnav, navit, viking, tangogps, foxtrot, obdgpslogger, geohist, LiveGPS, geoclue, qlandkartegt, gpredict, OpenCPN, gpsd-navigator, gpsd-ais-viewer, and firefox/mozilla. In addition, the Android smartphone operating system (from version 4.0 onwards and possibly earlier; we don't know for sure when the change happened) uses GPSD to monitor the phone's on-board GPS, so every location-aware Android app is indirectly a GPSD client.
